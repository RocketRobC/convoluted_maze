- **Requirement to find every item of swag in the shortest path**
- What's the best heuristic?
- Can a Manhattan heuristic help with a maze?

- Could the algorithm be changed to move any number of spaces until it finds a
corner and then turn? Each corner would become a node with with 2 or more
neighbours with a distance between. 
- How would you collect swag? You still need to check each cell.

- [x] Generate mazes with different path parameters
If a maze was generated with more whitespace then it would be a better
demonstration of finding the shortest path.

- Could you have a maze with more whitespace and heuristics guiding towards swag
of greater value?
