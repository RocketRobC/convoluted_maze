Convoluted Maze
===============

### Overview

The final project of the Codecademy Algorithms course requires generating a
random maze that's littered with randomly placed swag items to pick up. Using
the techniques learnt through the course you then need to find a path through
the maze collecting and sorting the swag you find along the way.
